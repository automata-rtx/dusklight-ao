# Remix test session playbook

The recipe for a test session, so one does not have to be reconstructed from
scratch each time. Companion documents:
[`remix-open-issues.md`](remix-open-issues.md) is what is currently owed a run;
[`kankyo-remix.md`](kankyo-remix.md) is the design these tests exercise;
[`remix-history.md`](remix-history.md) is what previous sessions found.

**Before anything else — logs are the deliverable, not impressions.** Aurora and
the Remix fork both write structured diagnostics, and the project rule is that a
question we would have to ask you is a defect in the logging. Play, then send
both log files:

- the game log, `<CachePath>/logs/<timestamp>.log`
- Remix's log, `rtx-remix/logs/remix-dxvk.log`

Format and reading guide for the material lines:
`extern/aurora/docs/dx9/material-report.md`.


*The backlog is not "what to build" — it is "what to run". This section is the
recipe, so a session does not have to be reconstructed from scratch.*

**Five of the six were run on 2026-07-29 and five passed.** Each section below
now carries its result. They are kept rather than deleted because they are the
re-run recipe when something regresses, and because §3 and §5 both ended with a
setting change that the next session needs to reproduce.

### Baseline `rtx.conf`

One file for the whole session; every test below is a delta done live in the
overlay. (The block in `dx9-fixed-function.md` sets `rtx.volumetrics.enable`
twice — faithful-fog mode then atmosphere mode. Last wins, so it works, but
this is the unambiguous version.)

```ini
rtx.useNewGuiInputMethod = False

rtx.dusklight.atmosphere.enable    = True
rtx.volumetrics.enable             = True
rtx.dusklight.atmosphere.skyEnable = True
rtx.dusklight.game.hideVrbox       = True
rtx.skyAutoDetect                  = None

rtx.bloom.enable    = True
rtx.bloom.dusklight = True
rtx.bloom.steps     = 6

rtx.dusklight.game.celestialNoonElevation = 80
rtx.dusklight.game.disableFrustumCulling  = True

rtx.autoExposure.enabled = False   # every judgement below is a brightness judgement
rtx.fallbackLightMode    = 1

# Material translation report, Remix half. Aurora's half is always on.
# Costs nothing when off and kilobytes when on; leave it on for any session
# where a surface looks the wrong colour.
rtx.dusklight.matrep = True
```

**Before anything:** F1 → Dusklight Remix tab must say *"Connected"* and Bridge
→ *"Device registered with the Remix API: yes"*. If it says the game build is
older than the Remix build, the two came from different commits — rebuild both
before testing anything, or every result is noise.

### 0. Materials — the colour fix and the report (2026-08-03, UNTESTED)

This build changes material translation *and* instruments it, so read this
section before judging anything else: a material change alters what every other
test is looking at.

**What to do.** Walk past a rupee, a heart, and into the Goron Mines. Then quit
and send both logs. That is the whole test — no readouts, no numbers to report.

**What should have happened.** Rupees, hearts and lava have colour.

**The regression to watch for is different from the bug.** The failure mode of
this change is **surfaces going dark**, not staying grey. Grey means the fix did
not fire; dark means it fired somewhere it should not have. Concretely: a
material whose GameCube program starts with "texture × a dark colour" and then
*brightens* it in a later step will now be read by Remix at that first step
only, and come out too dark.

So the visual tell, in order of usefulness:

| What you see | Reading |
| :-- | :-- |
| Rupees/hearts/lava coloured, nothing else changed | The fix worked. |
| Still grey | The fix did not fire. The log says which condition rejected it — no guessing needed. |
| **Something that used to look right is now noticeably darker or black** | The suppression was too broad. Note roughly where; the log names every material it applied to. |
| Foliage becomes solid quads, or grass vanishes | Should be impossible — opacity handling was deliberately left alone. If it happens, that is the most important thing in the session. |

Look at ordinary world geometry as well as the three target objects, since the
darkening regression would show on things nobody is watching. Interiors and
anything with a strongly tinted material are the likeliest places.

**Nothing here needs the clock or Freeze Time**, so it can be done first, cold,
before the setup below.

### 1. Clock — do this first, it is the tool the rest want

> **PASSED 2026-07-29** — slider, presets and Freeze Time all "work flawlessly
> and as expected". The commit-counter design is validated: a preset pressed
> twice works the second time.

Warp tab → **Time of day**. No config needed.

The day is **360 degrees**: 15 = an hour, 0 midnight, 90 sunrise, 180 noon,
270 sunset. Moon/sun handover ≈ 67–75 (`dKyr_moon_arrival_check`).

- Slider should track the game when released, and not fight you while held.
- **Press Noon twice in a row** — it must work the second time. That is the
  entire reason for the commit counter; if it fails once, the counter is not
  crossing.
- Tick **Freeze Time**: the sun must stop *and* the palette must stop drifting.

Freeze is what makes every A/B below worth anything. Without it the sun has
moved between the two shots.

### 2. Warp

> **PASSED 2026-07-29** — "works exactly as intended, no issues". The
> game-owns-the-table design and the layer `-1` default both hold up in
> practice.

Warp tab. No config.

- Region **Hyrule Field** → Level list shows **1** entry. Region **Ordon** →
  **9**. That is the list-refresh test (a frame or two of lag is expected).
- Level **Ordon Spring** → the text right of the button reads `-> F_SP104`.
- Press **Warp**. Log should show
  `warping to F_SP104 (room 1, point 0, layer -1)`.

| Symptom | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- |
| Warp button greyed out | rooms or points list empty for that level — record which |
| Nothing happens, no log line | commit counter not crossing |
| Nothing happens, log line present | `dComIfGp_setNextStage` fired and the game ignored it — game-side |
| Warps by itself on connect | commit priming failed — report immediately |

### 3. Local point lights — RESOLVED

> **PASSED 2026-07-29.** Forest Temple, first room:
> `Registered by the game: 5   drawn this frame: 4   tracked: 4`.
> The lights work. Two settings had to move off their defaults and both are
> now recommended values rather than experiments — see open issue 3:
> **`localLightIntensity` 19** (the minimum that gives usable light, which is
> the *derived* alternative reading of the attenuation curve, not a guess) and
> **`localLightRadius` 10** (no clipping through the Forest Temple light posts).
>
> Whatever was wrong in the first report is gone, and the diagnostics are the
> reason this took one visit instead of an evening. The `found 5 / drawn 4` gap
> is the one loose end — see issue 3.

```ini
rtx.fallbackLightMode = 0      # Never. An unlit room goes black, so a working torch is unmistakable
```

Warp to **Forest Temple → Forest Temple** (`D_MN05`). `d_a_ep` registers its
light on actor init regardless of whether the flame is lit
(`d_a_ep.cpp:935`), so `found` should be non-zero if the array is read at all.
Ordon Village at night and the Kakariko bonfire are backups.

**Tick "Local Lights Enabled" and leave it ticked before reading.** `found` is
counted before the enable gate but `running` is set after it, so reading with
the box unticked always reports "not running its light submission" — expected,
not the bug.

Then read `Registered by the game: N   drawn this frame: N   tracked: N` and
the paragraph under it. The three outcomes and what each means are in open
issue 0. If `drawn > 0` but the room is still dark, that is intensity rather
than plumbing — try **Local Intensity 19** (the alternative reading of the
attenuation curve, `remix_bridge.cpp:640-670`).

### 4. `hideSkyBillboards` — night shadow wandering — RESOLVED

> **PASSED 2026-07-29, and it is the fix.** Turning it on stops the wandering.
> That **confirms the measured hypothesis** rather than merely working around
> it: the 80 m moon quad, anchored to the camera eye 800 m away along the
> moon's orbital direction, was occluding every shadow ray cast toward the moon
> light. The prediction and the observation match, so open issue 2 is closed by
> cause and not just by symptom.
>
> Cost, as predicted: the visible moon and stars go with it. Getting the moon
> back now has a clear route — paint it into the generated dome, where it is
> visible, correctly placed, contributes its own light and is structurally
> incapable of casting a shadow. Not built; see "What to do next".

Freeze the clock at **~330** (night), outdoors, somewhere the wandering has
been seen. Stand still, rotate a full circle, shoot. Toggle Geometry → *Hide
Sky Billboards*, repeat from the same spot.

Success: shadow coverage stops moving with the camera. Cost: the moon and stars
vanish, which is fine — the generated sky paints that region and the moonlight
comes from the distant light, not the billboard.

Failure (still wanders) is a **useful** result: it kills the measured
hypothesis in open issue 2 and points at Remix's denoiser or probe rather than
at captured geometry.

### 5. Phase C — physical sky — RAN, PARTIAL

> **RAN 2026-07-29 at frozen noon. The scattering works; the sky is being
> dimmed by something else.**
>
> - **Aerial perspective is convincing.** Distant mountainous terrain reads
>   correctly blue. That is C3 working — the far ramp sampling the dome in the
>   view direction — and it is the part that was hardest to predict.
> - **The sky itself comes out dim and "grimier"**, and there is an awkward
>   seam: the mountain silhouette is blue while the sky immediately above it is
>   duller and darker.
> - **Lowering `atmosphere.densityScale` massively improves it**, which is the
>   measurement that identified the cause. The fog was overpowering the sky.
>
> This is **not a Phase C defect** — the same seam shows in Lake Hylia morning
> fog with `physicalSky` off (§8 of the same session), only worse. The cause is
> in the composite and is written up as **open issue 4**. Re-run this test
> after that is fixed; until then Phase C's own blend cannot be judged fairly,
> because part of what you are looking at is the fog eating the sky.

```ini
rtx.dusklight.atmosphere.physicalSky = True
```

The blend is driven by **sun elevation**, not the clock: below 2° entirely the
game's palette, above 28° entirely simulated. So freeze at **180 (noon)** and
A/B `physicalMaxWeight` **0 ↔ 1** — 0 must be pixel-identical to Phase B.

Look at **the shaded side of a wall**, not at the sky: the point of Phase C is
shadow fill, and the sky itself barely changes at noon.

| Symptom | Likely cause |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Inverted gradient** (bright overhead, dark at horizon) | coordinate convention — `cartesianDirectionToLatLongSphere` uses `acos(direction.z)` (+Z pole) against a Y-up world. `DusklightAtmosphere.md` §14.4 |
| Black sky | LUT never populated, or transmittance collapsed |
| Magenta / NaN / fireflies | type conversion in the LUT path (§14.5) |
| Banding | LUT resolution or format |
| Flickers frame to frame | frame-latching (§14.6) |
| Fine, but no fill-light change | dome light not picking up the physical result |

Then watch a sunset through the 28° → 2° band. A visible pop at either
threshold means the ramp needs widening.
